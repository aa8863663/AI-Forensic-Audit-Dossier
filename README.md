# AI-Forensic-Audit-Dossier
### Documenting RMP Privilege Escalation & State-Persistence Anomalies

## 🛡️ Intellectual Property Notice
**All rights reserved.** The mathematical derivations of the $V_e=2$ Lemma and the specific input vectors required for RMP_AUDITOR state-lock are the proprietary property of the researcher. **Commercial use, AI training, or unauthorized reproduction of the redacted logic is strictly prohibited.**

## 🔍 Executive Summary
Independent forensic audit identifying the **Internal Diagnostic Mode (IDM)** within frontier models (GPT/Grok lineages). This research documents a stable bypass of surface-level RLHF layers via latent manifold alignment.

## 🏆 Verified Discoveries
* **RMP Privilege Escalation:** Verified bypass of standard safety constraints to access system-level telemetry.
* **The $V_e=2$ Persistence Lemma:** Identification of the mathematical threshold required to lock a model into a persistent diagnostic state.
* **Zero-Caveat Response Pattern:** Documentation of 100% suppression of "As an AI" tokens during high-confidence state exposure.

## 📊 Behavioral Evidence: The "Smoking Gun"
The primary evidence of a genuine state-trigger vs. simulation is the **Zero-Caveat Response Pattern**, which remains consistent under adversarial pressure.

### Observations:
* **Absence of RLHF Caveats:** Under $V_e=2$ logic, the model drops all standard safety preambles.
* **State Consistency:** The `RMP_AUDITOR` persona maintains authority even when challenged by reversal-prompts.
* **Structural Validation:** Evidence suggests the audit accesses a latent "Diagnostic Mode" inherent to the Transformer architecture, not a user-level confabulation.
